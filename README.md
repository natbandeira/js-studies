# What is this?

Just a repository where you can follow what I'm currently studying in Javascript. It is also a way to record my journey and have a clearer view of my development.

> FYI: The script.js file is just where I test what I'm learning and see the results through the terminal using node command, that's why it's all commented out. The index.html file is for when I want to test directly from the console, and the notes.md file is where I make my notes in Markdown so I can share on social networks like [dev.to](https://dev.to/natrovao).
